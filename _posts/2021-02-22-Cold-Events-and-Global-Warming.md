title: Cold Events and Global Warming
---
The recent extreme cold event in the US has raised questions about its relation with human-caused warming. 
In the public discussion I've noticed the broadly held misconception that global warming increases those 
events or makes them worse. I don't think there is solid scientific evidence for this. To the contrary, I think 
the evidence indicates that, if anything, those events become less extreme and less frequent with global warming. 
So what causes this wide-spread misconception even from normally reliable and well-informed media outlets and public figures? 
Before addressing that question let me quickly document the discrepancy between media and science.

On tonights PBS Newshour [Bill Gates said](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/bill-gates-on-tackling-climate-change-and-the-ongoing-pandemic-response) 
"Well, the world has had these wind patterns 
that keep cold fronts from up in Canada from coming down into the Midwest. And as those wind patterns break down, 
it just makes events like last week substantially more common." From her lead-up to the interview it is clear that
Interviewer Judy Woodruff holds a similar belief: "All of us face the risk that extreme weather events like the recent 
one in Texas will become more common and more destructive occurrences because of climate change."

A few days ago Naomi Klein [wrote in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/21/opinion/green-new-deal-texas-blackout.html) 
"It was the very sort of freakish weather system now increasingly common, 
thanks to the unearthing and burning of fossil fuels like coal and gas." A few days ago Antonio Guterres, the UN Sectetary General, [said the 
following](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/press-encounter/2021-02-18/secretary-generals-joint-press-conference-executive-director-of-unep-inger-andersen-launch-unep-report-entitled-%E2%80%9Cmaking-peace-nature-scientific-blueprint-tackle): 
"Secretary-General:  Well, we are having global warming, clearly, as an average in the world. But at the same time, as we 
are having global warming as an average, another impact of climate change is that all storms, all oscillations are becoming more extreme. 
So, if you look at hurricanes, if you look at storms, but also if you look at heatwaves and coldwaves, they are becoming more extreme because 
of climate change. Climate change amplifies. So, as an average, the temperature is growing, and is growing too quickly. But the impact of 
storms of all kinds, including snowstorms, is also increasing dramatically. So, all this is a result, to a large extent, of climate change. 
And when they say, well, we don't need to be worried because, as a matter of fact, we are having a coldwave, this is total lack of scientific 
knowledge. This is complete ignorance."
