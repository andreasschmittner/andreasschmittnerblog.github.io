title: Imminent AMOC Collapse?
---
The recent paper by [Nicklas Boers (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01097-4) suggests the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) may be about to collapse. It has been picked up by the media with prominent features in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/us/gulf-stream-collapse.html), [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/08/05/change-ocean-collapse-atlantic-meridional/) and [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/05/climate-crisis-scientists-spot-warning-signs-of-gulf-stream-collapse), with misleading headlines and (IMO) too much hype of impending doom.
