The recent extreme cold event in the US has raised questions about its relation with human-caused warming. 
In the public discussion I've noticed the broadly held misconception that global warming increases those 
events or makes them worse. I don't think there is scientific evidence for this. So what causes this wide-spread 
misconception even from normally reliable and well-informed media outlets and public figures? But before we can 
address that question let me quickly document the discrepancy between media and science.

On tonights PBS Newshour [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/bill-gates-on-tackling-climate-change-and-the-ongoing-pandemic-response] (Bill Gates said) "Well, the world has had these wind patterns 
that keep cold fronts from up in Canada from coming down into the Midwest. And as those wind patterns break down, 
it just makes events like last week substantially more common." From her lead-up to the interview it is clear that
Interviewer Judy Woodruff holds a similar belief: "All of us face the risk that extreme weather events like the recent 
one in Texas will become more common and more destructive occurrences because of climate change."
